The rationales for the uprisings differed from place to place, but most were rooted in the unhappiness of local militias at concessions newly independent Indonesia had made to the Dutch or at its failure to accord due recognition to local guerrillas in the new national army. Religious factors were not paramount, but Islam became the common bond of the leaders, and by 1953, they had agreed to form a united front to establish the Islamic State of Indonesia (Negara Islam Indonesia, NII)...On 1 August 1962, after Kartosoewirjo was captured, the Indonesian army persuaded 32 of his top lieutenants to pledge allegiance to the government in exchange for amnesty.""

According to some high estimates, Mao's repression, radicalism and neglect may have been responsible for up to 80 million deaths. The material -- unearthed by Chinese and Western scholars, and an investigation by The Washington Post -- also shows that areas of China previously believed to have escaped the chaos of these campaigns were not immune from the tumult masterminded by Mao, who died in 1976 but is still revered or at least admired by many Chinese.(Washington Post, “Repression’s Higher Toll,” July 17, 1994, p. A1.)  NOT ALL FAMINE DEAD WERE INTENTIONAL""Although Mao did not want to kill or starve peasants per-se, like the other communist leaders studied in this chapter, when the famine struck his actions proved he was willing to pay a staggering price in human lives to achieve his radical goals.  As in the Soviet Union, a system of household registration kept peasants from fleeing to the cities or other areas where the famine was less severe.  Local granaries in some famine stricken areas remained full and peasants seeking access to them were shot... Not all the suffering visited on China during the Great Leap, however, was the result of the famine.  The party officially proscribed coercion, but communist officials sometimes tortured and killed those accused of failing to meet their grain quotas.  According to Jasper Becker, as the famine grew worse, 'Party cadres had increasingly to rely on force and terror to get the peasants to obey their orders.  At the height of the famine, they wielded the power of life and death because they controlled the grain stores and could kill anyone by depriving them of food.' As in the Soviet Union, the worst effects of the famine were specifically targeted at social groups suspected of hostility towards the regime... the radical communist agrarian policies of the Great Leap and the hunger they produced eventually provoked a significant amount of active resistance and in some cases open revolt from the peasantry.  The regime did not refrain from using violence to crush this resistance.   Secret Chinese military papers reveal that during the Great Leap Forward, “hunger and brutality precipitated widespread revolt and ‘armed banditry’...  Challenged, the party launched an all out effort to ‘suppress the counter-revolutionaries and pacify the countryside.""

That attributes a somewhat higher percentage of deaths to the Government and its allies than did a report last year by the Roman Catholic Church.... The report's estimate of more than 200,000 deaths is slightly higher than previous figures, and the number of documented massacres substantially exceeds previous figures. The war, which began in 1960, pitted a rightist military-controlled Government against a classic Latin American left-wing insurgency. In waging a war largely in the hinterlands where Mayans lived, the military assumed that the Mayans sympathized with the insurgents and provided them with supplies, information and shelter.

(Clodfelter, p. 719).""The study carried out by this Commission makes it clear that 1974-1977 stands apart as a distinct period. During those years, the DINA (National Intelligence Directorate) was responsible for most of the political repression, although the other intelligence services were also at work. It was during this period that most of the forced disappearances took place, and the DINA was the main agency that used such a method to eliminate people. Certainly many disappearances took place in the latter months of 1973, but for the most part these were efforts to evade responsibility for murder by hiding the bodies. By contrast, the instances of disappearance after arrest in the 1974-1977 period reflect a pattern of prior planning and centralized coordination. These features indicate that the intention was to eliminate particular categories of people, namely those who were regarded as politically very dangerous... In August 1977 the DINA was dissolved, and the CNI was created. From August to November 1977 for practical purposes the newly created CNI was still the DINA, since the man who served as the new organization's director during its first few years had not yet taken charge. Between November 1977 and mid-1980 under its first director, the CNI concentrated more on political intelligence than on repression. The number of fatal human rights violations cases declined dramatically, as can be observed in the statistics at the end of this volume... Between 1978 and 1981 there were some cases of disappearance, but they were not systematic in nature nor was the CNI responsible. Beginning in 1981 the CNI was responsible for a number of disappearances. The methods used were different from those used previously, and disappearance was employed selectively... Decree Law No. 219129 was issued in view of ""the ethical imperative to make all efforts conducive to strengthening the bonds uniting the Chilean nation, leaving behind hatreds that are meaningless today, and encouraging all those initiatives that might solidify the reunification of Chileans."" To that end, this Decree Law granted amnesty to those who had committed criminal actions while the state of siege was in effect from September 11, 1973 to March 10, 1978, or had been accomplices to, or covered up such actions, provided they were not already involved in a legal process or already sentenced when the law went into effect.

In a nine-volume document drawing on two years of testimony and investigation, Peru's Truth and Reconciliation Commission reported today that most of the killings of civilians were committed by the Shining Path, a radical Maoist insurgency that ravaged the countryside during the mid-1990s in its war against the Peruvian state. But the report was equally critical of Peru's aloof political class and its armed services, attributing just under half the atrocities committed over that time to the security forces and renewing a bitter debate over who bears responsibility for the war. Three of every four victims of the violence during that period -- in massacres, kidnappings and assassinations -- were Peruvians whose native language was Quechua or another indigenous tongue. Salomon Lerner, president of the 12-member commission, said Peru's security forces employed a ""systematic or generalized practice of human rights violations"" that could support charges of crimes against humanity... The commission's findings show Peru's political violence to be far broader and more intense than earlier believed, even by human rights experts who have been trying for decades to track the number of victims. Until now, the number of Peruvians who died or disappeared during the war and its aftermath was thought to be about 30,000.

One aid worker said that at least 30 people were killed by the army during one day's rioting last week in the provincial capital, Hargeisa. Other eyewitnesses to whom your correspondent talked said that during the past five days there have been demonstrations in many northern towns and villages. The immediate cause of the troubles is the government's decision to prosecute 27 northern intellectuals and businessmen accused of subversion. The first of several riots in Hargeisa took place on February 20th when a crowd stormed the courtroom. But northerners' grievances go far deeper than this; they believe the government discriminates against them in an increasingly repressive way. Mr. Barre, a southerner, is accused of favouring southern tribes and of exploiting the north.""

Recently four high school students were arrested, tortured and executed for ""distributing subversive leaflets"" criticizing the government of President Mohammed Siad Barre... Apart from repression of political enemies, he has executed and imprisoned Moslem religious leaders, intellectuals and villagers in northern towns where anti-government guerrillas operate.

By late 1990 the various rebel movements had combined to press Siad Barre forces back on the capital.  On December 27 [1990] Mogadishu became a battlefield.  The battle... ended on January 27, 1991, when the rebels captured the airfield and the presidential palace and Siad Barre fled into exile.  The ouster of Siad Barre did not bring peace to Somalia.  In November 1991 rival factions within the victorious coalition fought to gain power."" (Clodfelter, p. 618)""Faced with shrinking popularity and an armed and organized domestic resistance, Siad Barre unleashed a reign of terror against the Majeerteen, the Hawiye, and the Isaaq, carried out by the Red Berets (Duub Cas), a dreaded elite unit recruited from among the president's Mareehaan clansmen... In November 1986, the dreaded Red Berets unleashed a campaign of terror and intimidation on a frightened citizenry... The SNM launched a military campaign in 1988, capturing Burao on May 27 and part of Hargeysa on May 31. Government forces bombarded the towns heavily in June, forcing the SNM to withdraw and causing more than 300,000 Isaaq to flee to Ethiopia. The military regime conducted savage reprisals against the Isaaq. The same methods were used as against the Majeerteen-- destruction of water wells and grazing grounds and raping of women. An estimated 5,000 Isaaq were killed between May 27 and the end of December 1988. About 4,000 died in the fighting, but 1,000, including women and children, were alleged to have been bayoneted to death... In the late 1980s, disaffection with the regime set in among the Hawiye who felt increasingly marginalized in the Siad Barre regime. From the town of Beledweyne in the central valley of the Shabeelle River to Buulobarde, to Giohar, and in Mogadishu, the clan was subjected to ruthless assault. Government atrocities inflicted on the Hawiye were considered comparable in scale to those against the Majeerteen and Isaaq... The proliferation of insurgent movements prompted Mogadishu to become increasingly oppressive. In 1982, for example, the government declared a state of emergency in northern Somalia and took steps to suppress local populations. Additionally, laws were adopted that placed civilians under the jurisdiction of military tribunals and military police. Several institutions comprised this new security apparatus, including the Mobile Military Court (MMC), the Regional Security Council (RSC), the HANGASH (Somali acronym for military police), the NSS, and the Victory Pioneers... Over the years, the NSS used the national security rationale to justify the arrest, execution, or imprisonment of hundreds, if not thousands, of real and imagined government opponents. The Victory Pioneers were a uniformed militia that provided security at the neighborhood level. Pioneer units, which existed in every town and village, ensured loyalty to Siad Barre's regime by encouraging people to spy on each other in the work place, schools, mosques, and private homes... After the SNM launched a major offensive in northern Somalia in late May 1988, deterioration of the government's human rights record accelerated. The SNA used artillery shelling and aerial bombardment in heavily populated urban centers to retake the towns of Hargeysa and Burao. As a result, thousands of refugees gathered on the outskirts of these cities. After breaking into smaller groups of 300 to 500, the refugees started a ten- to forty-day trek to Ethiopia; others fled to Djibouti and Kenya. Along the way, SNA units robbed many civilians and summarily executed anyone suspected of being an SNM member or sympathizer. SAF jet aircraft strafed many refugee columns, forcing refugees to walk at night to avoid further attacks. Africa Watch reported that government forces had killed as many as 50,000 unarmed civilians between June 1988 and January 1990; most victims belonged to the northern Isaaq clan.""

The conflict, which reached a peak between 1992-1995, has been characterized by severe human rights abuses by both the security forces and the PKK. The government intensified a counterinsurgency campaign against the PKK, forcibly evacuating and burning rural villages. The majority of the more than 2,500 villages and hamlets depopulated in the region since 1984 are believed to be the result of this campaign... By 1992, the conflict in the southeast entered a new spiral. Torture and deaths in detention increased, as did disappearances under mysterious circumstances. A wave of so-called “actor unknown murders” believed linked to or tolerated by security forces struck Kurdish nationalist intellectuals and journalists and also suspected PKK members, with the number of such deaths rising to 1,288 between 1992 and 1995. For its part, the PKK is also guilty of severe human rights abuses, intimidating and murdering those who stand in its way. The PKK assassinated individuals suspected of “cooperating with the state,” such as teachers, civil servants, and former PKK members. Between 1992-1995, the PKK is believed to have committed at least 768 politically-motivated assassinations.

Military officers even carried out some of these executions in the area where the crimes were committed, inviting local residents to witness the executions. Despite protests by several international organizations, these executions continued in 1990.

Despite these harsh measures, human rights violations continued in parts of northern, eastern, and western Uganda in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In October 1987, for example, witnesses reported that soldiers killed 600 people in Tororo District during an NRA counterinsurgency operation.

Shoup, The War in Bosnia-Herzegovina: Ethnic Conflict and International Intervention (Armonk: M.E. Sharpe, 1999), p. 169).""By my count, the number of fatalities in Bosnia's war isn't 200,000 but 25,000 to 60,000 -- total, from all sides... Images of a killing field lingered, personified in grim photographs of skeletal Muslim men in Serbian concentration camps. That backdrop made it easy for Haris Silajdzic, then Bosnia's Foreign Minister, to give the first big boost in the number of deaths. In December 1992, he told journalists that there were 128,444 dead on the Bosnian side (including Croats and Serbs loyal to the Bosnian Government). He evidently got the figure by adding together the 17,466 confirmed dead and the 111,000 that the Bosnian Institute of Public Health had estimated to be missing. An able politician, Silajdzic understood the benefit of apparent slaughter. In the West, it meant political support; in the Islamic world, much-needed donations to lubricate the Bosnian war machine.  At first, such high numbers didn't take. But on June 28, 1993 -- as near as I can pin it down -- the Bosnian Deputy Minister of Information, Senada Kreso, told journalists that 200,000 had died. Knowing her from her service as my translator and guide around Sarajevo, I believe that this was an outburst of naive zeal... For Bosnia, an area slightly larger than Tennessee, to have suffered more than 200,000 deaths would have meant roughly 200 deaths per day, every day, for the three-plus years of war. But the fighting rarely, if ever, reached that level. After the Serbs carved out the areas they wanted in 1992, fighting declined steadily, reaching a virtual stalemate by autumn 1993. Now on the front lines, combatants often shoot past each other, tacitly understanding that in a low-intensity war nobody wants to get hurt. Outright warfare, therefore, has probably resulted in deaths measured in the tens of thousands, including civilians. If there were huge numbers of other dead, they could be accounted for only by systematic killing in concentration camps or the complete, as-yet-undiscovered extermination of entire villages... The Red Cross has confirmed well under 20,000 fatalities on all sides. Extrapolating from that and from the observations of experienced investigators in Bosnia, its analysts estimate total fatalities at 20,000 to 30,000, with a small chance that they may exceed 35,000.  Analysts at the CIA. and the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research put fatalities in the tens of thousands but hesitate to give a more precise range until the war is over. European military intelligence officers with extensive experience in Bosnia estimate fatalities in the mid tens of thousands. From these and other estimates by generally reliable relief workers, and given the arguments about the physical impossibility of high numbers, I arrived at the range of 25,000 to 60,000 fatalities.""

But last month, in a book review, he questioned the oft-cited number of 200,000 -- or even 250,000 -- who have died in that war. Kenney said his Red Cross sources estimate 20,000 to 30,000 dead; after checking with other international sources, he figures 25,000 to 60,000 have died.  Most of the global press has adopted the estimates of the Bosnian government: It says 144,268 civilians and soldiers have been killed in the 65 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina reporting casualties -- thus an estimate of more than 200,000 killed nationwide. Many international agencies also use the 200,000 number, as does the U.S. government -- but U.S. analysts freely admit they culled their figure from press reports. Some data do appear valid. The Bosnians say 10,070 have been killed and 58,780 wounded in Sarajevo, a city with intact hospitals and morgues. Those figures fit most warfare dead-to-wounded ratios of three to five wounded for each person killed. Nationwide, however, the Bosnians list about the same number of wounded as killed. One explanation is that their death total could also include those who are missing, but the Bosnians reject that interpretation. How many dead? 200,000 - THE BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT: The U.S. government and Amnesty International cite this figure; 100,000 - BOSNIAN SERBS: The real number, they insist, could be as low as 80,000; 26,000-60,000 - SIPRI Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimate.""

Two months later Professor Mojaddedi's government was replaced by another interim government, this time led by Borhanuddin Rabbani. This government was supposed to stay in office for four months, during which it was to hold elections. However, President Rabbani soon announced that elections would not be held because of the continuing civil war.

Chechen state council chairman Taus Dzhabrailov said the total included those killed during a first war, which lasted from 1994-1996, and the second, which began in 1999 and continues today. Of the 160,000 killed, about 100,000 were ethnic-Russian servicemen and civilians, and 30-40,000 were ethnic Chechen fighters and civilians, he told journalists, without giving a further breakdown, or explaining the gap of at least 20,000 in his tally. About 1.2 million people lived in Chechnya before the start of the first war. A large portion of the approximately 400-450,000 people in the capital Grozny were ethnic-Russians. The city was devastated by Russian air and artillery bombardments, resulting in massive civilian casualties. ""They never thought they would have bombs dropped on their heads or be shot at by heavy weapons,"" he said. Official military death tolls for the two wars come to about 10,000 Russian soldiers, although independent estimates are at least twice that. At the lower figure, Dzhabrailov's statistic would suggest that about 90,000 ethnic-Russian non-combatants died in Chechnya. Human rights groups cast doubt on the credibility of the figures, saying that Russian officials are not known for giving accurate accounts of civilian or military losses in Chechnya. Chechnya expert Alexander Cherkasov at the Russian human rights organisation Memorial said that following the first war the state statistics office published an estimate of 30-40,000 civilians killed. Memorial estimated the figure at 50,000. Accurate figures have been even harder to come by during the second war, during which access for journalists and independent researchers has been tightly restricted. According to Cherkasov, figures from the US organisation Human Rights Watch and from Memorial show that in the second war about 25,000 civilians have been killed, as many as 10,500 of them in the winter of 1999-2000 during the Russian storming of Grozny. That would give an independently researched total figure of about 75,000 civilians for both wars. ""Dzhabrailov's statement was political. The state has never counted the civilian losses,"" Cherkasov said. ""The Chechen government has not done what it needs to. It has not made lists of the dead, the lists of the disappeared. It has not found the mass graves."" (Agence France Presse, ""Chechnya's two wars have claimed 160,000 lives,"" August 15, 2005).  Suggests best estimate is 75,000 civilians.""The available evidence shows that enforced disappearances in Chechnya are both widespread and systematic. According to government statistics, at least 2,090 people have “disappeared” since the conflict started in 1999; human rights groups estimate the figure to be between three thousand and five thousand.10 As this briefing paper shows, the victims are always civilians or individuals who, when taken from their homes, checkpoints or other locations, are unarmed—they are hors de combat. They are predominantly men between eighteen and forty years old, although, after several Chechen female suicide bombers targeted civilians in Russia, women have also increasingly become victims of “disappearances.” In two of the forty-three cases reflected in this briefing paper the victims were minors under eighteen years old. In the vast majority of cases, the perpetrators are unquestionably government agents— either federal forces or, as is increasingly the case, local Chechen security forces who are ultimately subordinate to the Russian federal Ministry of Internal Affairs or the Ministry of Defense... Many of those who “disappear” in the custody of Russian or pro-Moscow Chechen forces also become victims of torture and extrajudicial executions. Bodies of people who had been previously taken into custody and then “disappeared” are regularly found in Chechnya.""

Even before the Maoists launched their “people’s war” in February 1996, the government had begun efforts to rout out its most radical critics. In November 1995, a police operation code-named Operation Romeo was launched in Rolpa district, the heart of the Maoist movement. Officially, Operation Romeo was labeled as an operation to control a rise in criminal activities in Rolpa, but in reality the operation focused on trying to dislodge the militant Maoist presence in the area. Operation Romeo resulted in gross violations of human rights, including the arbitrary arrest and detention of hundreds of members of left-of-center parties, rapes, executions and “disappearances.” (Human Rights Watch, ""BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE: Civilians Struggle to Survive in Nepal’s Civil War,"" Human Rights Watch Report, Vol. 16 No. 12C (October 2004), pp. 9-10).""Nepal's former Maoist guerrillas joined an interim government yesterday under a peace deal that finally takes them into the political mainstream after a decade-long conflict.

Five years later, the Royal Nepali Army (RNA) took over from the police direct control of the war effort. The RNA’s involvement did not quell the insurgency, but it did markedly increase the war’s lethality, particularly for civilians. All together some 13,000 Nepalis have been killed in the conflict; the respected Nepali human rights group INSEC recorded over eight thousand mostly civilian deaths since November 2001. It was also during this period that Nepal took on the ignominious distinction of having the highest number of new cases of “disappearances” reported to the United Nations in the world, some 1,700, of which the vast majority (1,300) was blamed on government security forces. The Maoist forces meanwhile were implicated in numerous cases of killings, abductions, torture, extortion, and use of children for military purposes... The Maoists have established their presence in many rural areas by engaging in routine murder, torture, extortion, and abduction. Government security forces, unable to counter the Maoists’ intrusion into villages, have turned to creating and arming citizen defense units, commonly referred to as vigilante groups, to serve as their proxies, drawing on local villagers fearful of or seeking revenge against the Maoists, as well as local thugs eager to acquire weapons and power. The introduction of barely trained armed vigilantes further blurs the distinction between civilians and combatants, placing civilians at greater risk. The cycle of attacks and reprisals by Maoists and vigilantes risks spiraling out of control and adding to the war’s many atrocities. The danger of vigilante forces committing uncontrolled brutality was gruesomely demonstrated in February 2005 when the Village Defense Force in the central Terai district of Kapilvastu retaliated against a Maoist attack on two village officials by attacking suspected Maoist sympathizers. Vigilante-backed mob violence escalated and soon entire villages were being attacked. The violence lasted three days, during which at least forty-six people were killed, most of them unarmed civilians, and a fourteen-year-old girl was raped. Six hundred houses were burned. Human Rights Watch’s recent research found compelling evidence that in the last year the government has created and sponsored vigilante groups throughout the southern Terai region, from Bardiya in the west to Ilam in the far east. Senior leaders of vigilante groups in Rupandehi and Nawalparaisi admitted that they received official government support, including rifles and shotguns, a one-month-long training program at RNA barracks and government licenses identifying them as members of “Village Peace and Development Volunteer Mobilization Groups.” Vigilantes in Rupandehi brandished rifles they had received from the RNA, but complained that they did not receive automatic weapons, and that they had to collect donations from local residents to pay for ammunition... Human Rights Watch’s recent investigation found evidence that under sustained international pressure, government security forces have decreased some of their most egregious practices, such as carrying out extrajudicial killings, “disappearances,” and long-term arbitrary detentions. However, torture and other forms of mistreatment of detainees remain widespread. Nepali security forces continue to enjoy near total impunity from prosecution for human rights abuses.""

Many of these violations can be shown to have been “widespread or systematic,” a criterion of crimes against humanity. Although committed in an internal armed conflict, violations involving direct attacks on civilians, indiscriminate attacks, or disproportionate attacks are increasingly being recognized internationally as amounting to war crimes. (See Chapter II.) The examples of human rights and humanitarian law violations by the Taliban provided in Chapter II date primarily from 1999-2001, when its forces were on the offensive or occupying captured territory. These offensives were accompanied by the use of scorched-earth tactics in the Shamali plains north of Kabul, summary executions of detainees in the north-central province of Samangan, and forced relocation and conscription...In August 1998 Taliban forces opened their third assault on Mazar-i Sharif, and this time took the city decisively. They massacred at least 2,000 people, most of them Hazara civilians, after they took the city, and killed an unknown number of people in aerial bombardments... In addition, the Taliban has committed other serious violations of internationally recognized human rights outside of the context of armed conflict. Minorities have suffered from discrimination and other abuses, including arbitrary arrest and torture. Summary trials of suspected criminals frequently result in harsh sentences involving corporal punishment under the Taliban's strict interpretation of Islamic law."" (Human Rights Watch, ""AFGHANISTAN: CRISIS OF IMPUNITY,"" Human Rights Watch Report, vol. 13, No. 3C (July 2001), p. 6, 17).  The report mentions 2,291 killed in specific incidents of massacres during the war, but this is clearly an underestimate (other groups estimate 5,000 killed in Mazar-i Sharif massacre alone).""After being attacked twice last year by the Taliban, the radical Islamic movement that controls most of Afghanistan, Mazar-e Sharif could no longer claim to be that battered country's last refuge from civil war. But hardly anyone in the dusty city on the northern plains was prepared for what happened when Taliban militiamen took control with a vengeance on their third try. On Aug. 8 and the days that followed, Taliban militiamen and their allies -- including militant Muslims from neighboring Pakistan -- methodically executed between 2,000 and 5,000 civilians in one of the deadliest mass killings of civilians in two decades of warfare in Afghanistan, according to interviews with witnesses who later fled to Pakistan and reports by international human rights investigators. Taliban militiamen searched house to house for males of fighting age who belonged to the Hazara ethnic minority. Hazaras were gunned down in front of their families or had their throats slit in the same way Muslims slaughter goats for holiday feasts. Others, thrown into the city's overcrowded jail, were executed by firing squads or crammed into tractor-trailers, where they sweltered all day in the summer sun -- doors shut -- until most perished from suffocation or heat stroke. In the evenings, the heavy trucks hauled the bodies to the nearby desert and dumped them in heaps like trash, according to the reports. Sketchy reports of the slaughter were circulated at the time, but the full extent and the systematic character of the mass murder there have only become known in the months since, as human rights investigators have interviewed survivors who fled to Pakistan and elsewhere... The killings illustrate how the Afghan civil war -- which began in 1978 to overturn communist rule, raged during a 10-year Soviet occupation and eventually settled into factional fighting -- has in the past two years turned toward ethnic conflict fed by tribal hatreds and blood revenge. Although the Taliban fought its way to dominance under a unifying banner of Islam, in ethnic terms its rule represents a return to the pre-communist days of rule by Pashtuns, Afghanistan's largest ethnic group. In taking over Mazar-e Sharif, the Taliban also added a sectarian twist. The Hazara group that was singled out for slaughter is predominantly Shiite Muslim; the Taliban is a Sunni Muslim movement.""

Through its own research, Human Rights Watch documented 3,453 killings by Serbian or Yugoslav government forces, but that number is definitely lower than the total, because it is based on only 577 interviews (and these interviews were not randomly sampled to allow for extrapolation of the data to all of Kosovo). At the same time, the number is certainly not as large as some Western government and NATO officials suggested during the war, when figures went as high as 100,000. As of July 2001, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) had exhumed approximately 4,300 bodies believed to have been victims of unlawful killings by Serbian and Yugoslav forces in Kosovo. This is certainly less than the total number of those killed by government troops. Most importantly, there is incontrovertible evidence of grave tampering and the removal of bodies by Serbian and Yugoslav troops, as the post-Milosevic Serbian government was beginning to confirm in summer 2001.

But the number of bodies discovered so far is much lower -- 2,108 as of November, and not all of them necessarily war-crimes victims. While more than 300 reported grave sites remain to be investigated, the tribunal has checked the largest reported sites first, and found most to contain no more than five bodies, suggesting intimate acts of barbarity rather than mass murder. The KLA helped form the West's wartime image of Kosovo.

In 1999 the major parties to the war signed the Lusaka Peace Accords, resulting in the deployment in 2000 of a United Nations force, the U.N. Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) to monitor arrangements for ending the conflict. But the accords were not respected and the DRC was in effect divided among four regimes, each of which depended on foreign troops to survive. After further negotiation, the DRC government reached an accord on future political arrangements with two of the three major rebel movements, the MLC and RCD-ML.1 Known as the Sun City accord, the agreement was signed in April 2002 without the signature of the third important rebel movement, the RCD-Goma. After further international pressure and shuttle diplomacy, the government of the DRC signed bilateral accords with Rwanda (July 2002) and with Uganda (September 2002), paving the way for withdrawal of their troops. The Rwandan soldiers left in October and Ugandan troops began withdrawing soon after, although some stayed on. In early 2003 Uganda briefly increased the number of its soldiers in Ituri, but under significant international pressure it started its final withdrawal of troops in May. In April 2003 RCD-Goma joined the other DRC parties to the conflict in the All Inclusive Agreement on the Transitional Government, meant to settle interim political arrangements. Despite the agreements and the troop movements, the war in Ituri intensified as local surrogates carried on the battles of the national and international actors.

There was good reason to be worried. United Nations peacekeeping troops had to evacuate the president of the Independent Electoral Commission when fighting came too close to his office. He had to make the delayed announcement of election results in a hastily prepared alternative location. Kabila emerged as the frontrunner out of a field of 33 candidates, though without an absolute majority. A run-off vote between Kabila and his nearest challenger Bemba was announced for this month. Two days of street battles followed. At one point fourteen ambassadors were trapped in Bemba’s residence, where they had gone to urge calm. Presidential guards exchanged fire with Bemba’s troops on the streets outside. U.N. peacekeepers, supported by a small European force eventually freed the ambassadors and defused the crisis.

Banditry, localized issues, people trying to resolve issues over water and land at a local level. But real war as such, I think we are over that.''  Senior United Nations officials said that while General Agwai was basically correct, they did not want to play down the dire consequences some three million displaced people face in Darfur...

Though the level of fighting has diminished there, he said, an additional 140,000 people have sought refuge in camps since January. ''It is still far from peaceful,'' he said.  Factors contributing to the diminished fighting include a splintering of opposition groups and reduced outside support, officials said. Most current deaths in Darfur come from criminal activity, United Nations officials said, while hundreds of people have been killed in recent months in clashes in the south.Susan Rice, the American ambassador to the United Nations, has continued to call the conflict in Darfur genocide, and officials said she upbraided Rodolphe Adada, the departing civilian head of the peacekeeping forces, after he described Darfur as a ''low-intensity conflict'' this year...

Mr. Adada resigned after sustained criticism that he was too soft on the Khartoum government. General Agwai is rotating out, to be succeeded by another officer.

Miftah Duwadi, the deputy minister of martyrs and missing persons, told the Libya Herald newspaper that the numbers for revolutionary losses were being checked but officials did not expect major changes.  Arguments about casualty figures have become bound up in political disagreements about the 2011 conflict. Opponents of Nato's armed intervention in support of the uprising often argue it caused many more deaths than would have been the case without it.  The UN Security Council authorised action to protect Libyan civilians from the Gaddafi regime but Russia, China and other critics believe that the western alliance exceeded that mandate and moved to implement regime change. Initially rebel officials believed that some 50,000 people had been killed, a figure that was revised down to 25,000 dead and 4,000 missing in October 2011. The latest statistics have been compiled after research by the ministry, though they do not include the final figure for fatalities on the Gaddafi side.

Government forces responded by arresting and attacking peaceful demonstrators in Benghazi and other eastern cities. The government used excessive force when protests spread to the western cities of Tripoli, the capital, Misrata, Zawiya, Zuwara, and Zintan. Human Rights Watch documented the government’s lethal use of live fire on peaceful protesters, as well as the arrest and disappearance of hundreds of people suspected of involvement in anti-government demonstrations... From February until August, when Tripoli fell, Gaddafi forces arrested thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people across the country, including anti-government protesters, suspected government critics, and people alleged to have provided information to international media and human rights organizations. Many of those arrested were fighters, but many others were civilians, including doctors, journalists, and people caught in areas where fighting took place... Detainees who were released from government custody during and after the conflict reported frequent torture, including beatings with wooden sticks and plastic pipes, and the use of electric shock. Some prisoners apparently died from the abuse or the subsequent lack of medical care.... In the fighting, government forces repeatedly launched indiscriminate attacks with mortars and GRAD rockets into civilian-inhabited areas, especially in Misrata and towns of the western mountains. The coastal city of Misrata suffered a two-month siege with near daily attacks that killed scores of civilians and for a while blocked delivery of humanitarian aid... During the conflict, and especially just before the fall of Tripoli, Gaddafi forces executed prisoners in their custody. Members of the Khamis Brigade, a powerful military force run by Gaddafi’s son Khamis, appear to have summarily executed at least 45 detainees in a warehouse in Tripoli in August. Thirty-four bodies exhumed from a mass grave near the town of al-Qawalish in western Libya in August seemed to be those of men detained by Gaddafi forces in early June. In September the bodies of 18 detainees, who died by suffocation when detained by Gaddafi forces in June in al-Khoms, were discovered buried in western Libya. In May security forces apparently executed 10 antigovernment protesters in Bani Walid.  At this writing Libya was still dealing with the problem of missing persons from the conflict. The number of missing and dead remains unclear. Mass graves continued to be discovered, but the lack of forensic expertise complicated the identification process.""

There is no doubt that civilians did expect to be killed after threats of vengeance from Gaddafi. During the first days of the uprising in eastern Libya, security forces shot and killed demonstrators and people attending their funerals, but there is no proof of mass killing of civilians on the scale of Syria or Yemen.  Most of the fighting during the first days of the uprising was in Benghazi, where 100 to 110 people were killed, and the city of Baida to the east, where 59 to 64 were killed, says Amnesty. Most of these were probably protesters, though some may have obtained weapons.  Amateur videos show some captured Gaddafi supporters being shot dead and eight badly charred bodies were found in the remains of the military headquarters in Benghazi, which may be those of local boys who disappeared at that time… The Amnesty findings confirm a recent report by the authoritative International Crisis Group, which found that while the Gaddafi regime had a history of brutally repressing opponents, there was no question of ""genocide"".

This version would appear to ignore evidence that the protest movement exhibited a violent aspect from very early on. While there is no doubt that many and quite probably a large majority of the people mobilised in the early demonstrations were indeed intent on demonstrating peacefully, there is also evidence that, as the regime claimed, the demonstrations were infiltrated by violent elements. Likewise, there are grounds for questioning the more sensational reports that the regime was using its air force to slaughter demonstrators, let alone engaging in anything remotely warranting use of the term “genocide”.

The fresh attacks this month, in which scores have been killed, were a reminder of the divisions still driving violence in areas where the Islamic State has been ousted."" (Washington Post, January 19, 2016).""At least 72 people from a majority Sunni village in eastern Iraq were methodically singled out for slaughter this week, according to witnesses and local Sunni leaders, who said the victims were killed by Shiite militiamen who were supporting Iraqi security forces. ""(The New York Times, January 30, 2015)""The full extent of the horror that has unfolded across Iraq over the past year is revealed in an interactive story map published by Amnesty International today, detailing the plight of Iraqi civilians caught in a deadly spiral of horrific crimes by the armed group calling itself the Islamic State (IS) and brutal revenge attacks by the now dominant government-backed Shi’a militias and government forces. Within the story map, the organization is publishing two briefings, which contain its findings on two massacres carried out in January 2015 apparently to avenge IS crimes: the massacre of at least 56 Sunni Arab men - possible more than 70 - in Barwana, a village in Diyala province, by Shi’a militiamen and government forces, and the killing of 21 Sunni Arab villagers in the Sinjar region by members of a Yezidi militia.""
